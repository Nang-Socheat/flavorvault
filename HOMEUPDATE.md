# Home Page Update Plan

Due to file length, I'll create an entirely new enhanced Home.jsx file with all the modern features and styling.

New features to add:
1. Enhanced stats cards with gradients and micro-animations
2. Recipe of the Day spotlight
3. Meal time quick filters (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks)
4. Trending/Popular recipes section
5. Modern realistic UI with depth and patterns
6. Better category showcase with enhanced emojis
7. Interactive badges and labels
8. Improved hover states and transitions
